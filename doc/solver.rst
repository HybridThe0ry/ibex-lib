This page describes the IbexSolve, the plugin installed with the ``--with-solver`` option.


**The documentation is under construction.**


=================
Getting started
=================

IbexSolve is a end-user program that solves a system of nonlinear equations rigorously
(that is, it does not lose any solution and return each solution under the form of a 
small box enclosing the true value). It resorts to
a unique black-box strategy (whatever the input problem is) and with a very limited 
number of parameters. Needless to say, this strategy is a kind of compromise and not the 
best one for a given problem.

Note that this program is based on the :ref:`generic solver <generic-solver>`, a C++ class
that allows to build a more customizable solver.

You can directly apply this solver on one of the benchmark problems 
distributed with Ibex. 
The benchmarks are all written in the `Minibex syntax`_ and stored in an arborescence under ``plugins/solver/benchs/``.

.. _Minibex syntax: #func-minibex

Open a terminal, move to the ``bin`` subfolder and run IbexSolve with, for example, the problem named kolev36 located at the specified path::

  ~/ibex-2.6.0$ cd bin
  ~/ibex-2.6.0/bin$ ./ibexsolve ../plugins/solver/benchs/others/kolev36.bch
	
The following result should be displayed::

The number of "inner boxes" correspond to the number of solutions found (there is just one here). To see the solution, use the option ``-s``.

In the report, the "number of cells" correspond to the number of hypothesis (bisections) that was required to solve the problem.

================== 
The generic solver
================== 

The generic solver is the main C++ class behind the implementation of ``ibexsolve``.
It is a classical branch and prune algorithm that interleaves contraction and branching (bisection) until
boxes get sufficiently small. However, it performs a more general task that just finding solution points of square
systems of equations: it also knows how to deal with under-constrained systems and handle manifolds. The documentation
about under-constrained systems will be available soon.

Compared to ``ibexsolve``, the generic solver allows the following additional operators as inputs:

#. a **contractor** 
       
    Operator that contracts boxes by removing non-solution points. The contraction operator must be compatible with the 
    system given (equations/inequalities). The solver performs no check (it is the user responsability).

#. a **bisector**           

    Operator that splits a box. Note that some bisectors have a *precision* parameter: the box is bisected providing 
    it is large enough. But this precision is not directly seen by the solver which has its own precision variables 
    (see ``-e`Ì€  and ``-E``). If however the bisector does not split a box, this will generate an exception caught by the solver,
    which will not continue the search and backtrack. So fixing the bisector internal precision gives basically the same effect
    as fixing it with ``--e``. See :ref:`strategy-bisectors` for more details. 

#. a **cell buffer**
  
    Operator that manages the list of pending boxes (a *cell* is a box with a little bit of extra information used by the search).
    See :ref:`strategy-cell-buffers` for more details.

Our next example creates a solver for the intersection of two circles of radius :math:`d`, 
one centered on :math:`(0,0)` and the other in :math:`(1,0)`. 

To this end we first create a vector-valued function:

.. math::
	(x,y) \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} x^2+y^2-d \\ (x-1)^2+y^2-d \end{pmatrix}

Then, we build two contractors; a :ref:`forward-bacwkard <ctc-fwd-bwd>` contractor and (because the system is square),
an :ref:`interval Newton <tuto-newton>` contractor.		


We chose as bisection operator the *round-robin* operator, that splits each component in turn.
The precision of the solver is set to 1e-7.

Finally, the cell buffer is a stack, which leads to a depth-first search.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/doc-solver.cpp 
   :language: cpp
   :start-after: basic-solver-C
   :end-before: basic-solver-C

The output is:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/doc-solver.txt 
   :language: cpp
   :start-after: basic-solver-O
   :end-before: basic-solver-O
