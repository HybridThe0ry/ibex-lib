# Description

This plugin implements *ibexMop*, an 
interval branch & bound solver for **Nonlinear BiObjective Optimization** problems 
in the library [Ibex](https://github.com/ibex-team/ibex-lib).

*ibexMop* returns a set of solutions X and its images Y
guaranteeing a maximal distance *eps* between
any *non-dominated* feasible vector and the returned set Y. 

*ibexMop* constructs an **envelope** for the non-dominated set
by following a branch & bound strategy starting with an initial *box* (containing the variable domains) 
and building a search tree. In each iteration of the algorithm, 
a node is selected and treated by classical *filtering*, *upper-bounding* 
and *splitting* techniques. 

*ibexMop* includes some methods to take into account the upper bound of the 
*envelope* for filtering dominated solutions (e.g., well-known discarding tests).

*ibexMop* also offers several improvements related to other NLBOO algorithms:

* Uses a termination criteria directly related with the 
precision of the *envelope*.

* Includes an additional dynamic constraint for better defining the feasible 
objective region related to each box. This constraint is used 
by the filtering procedures improving the perfomance of the solver.

In the right side the strategy using the additional constraint which allows  
to approximate better the *envelope* of non-dominated solutions.

* Includes *NDSdist* a new strategy for selecting nodes. *NDSdist*
selects in each iteration the node/box maximizing its distance to the
upper envelope.
*NDSdist* has an anytime behaviour, i.e., it can return valid solutions
even if it is interrupted before it ends. See the figure below:

after 100 iterations (top) and [*tan*](https://github.com/INFPUCV/ibex-lib/blob/master/plugins/optim-mop/benchs/MOP/tan.txt) 
after 50 iterations (down), 
using the [OC search strategy](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221716303824) (left) 
and the *NDSdist* search strategy (right).

* Includes a [inner polytope algorithm](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.653.5777&rep=rep1&type=pdf) 
for updating the upper envelope using feasible solutions. 
The algorithm constructs a feasible and convex polytope and then it finds 
two feasible vectors inside the polytope by minimizing a linearization of each one of the 
objective functions in the polytope. 
Then it finds a set of $n-2$ equidistant feasible solutions 
between this two vectors.

# Instalation

## Requirements

Optim-mop is a Plugin for the Ibex-Lib, so it's neccesary to have it before you could install it.
This repo includes it, but if you just want to add this pluggin for your own installation, you could download the ibex-mop.zip that is in this folder and add it to the plugins folder in your ibex root directory.

## Configure

Once you have the optim-mop in your plugins folder, you should go to the root folder of your ibex-lib and run the following line in your terminal.

```
./waf configure --with-optim --with-optim-mop --with-ampl --with-affine --prefix=. --gaol-dir= --lp-lib=soplex
```
```
./waf install
```

This will configure Ibex to use the Optimizer MOP plugin and then build it in:
```
<ibex-root>/__build__/plugins/optim-mop/
```
