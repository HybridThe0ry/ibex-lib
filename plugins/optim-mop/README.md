# Description

Interval based solvers are commonly used for solving 
single-objective non linear optimization problems. 
Their reliability and increasing performance make them useful
when proofs of infeasibility and/or certification of solutions
are a must.
On the other hand, there exist only a few approaches dealing with
non linear optimization problems, when they consider multiple objectives. 

# Instalation

## Requirements

Optim-mop is a Plugin for the Ibex-Lib, so it's neccesary to have it before you could install it.
This repo includes it, but if you just want to add this pluggin for your own installation, you should add this folder to the plugins folder in your ibex directory.

Additionaly, you shoul have soplex installed in yoursystem.

## Configure

Once you have the optim-mop folder in your plugins folder, you should go to the root folder of your ibex-lib and run the following line in your terminal.

```
./waf configure --with-optim --with-optim-mop --with-ampl --with-affine --prefix=. --gaol-dir= --lp-lib=soplex
```
```
./waf install
```

This will configure Ibex to use the Optimizer MOP plugin and then build it in:
```
<ibex-root>/__build__/plugins/optim-mop/
```

# Uses
```
./ibexmop {OPTIONS} [filename]
```

Inside benchs/MOP folder you could find Multi Objective Problems to solve.

## Examples:

To run an example just write this in your terminal inside the ibex root:
```
./__build__/plugins/optim-mop/ibexmop plugins/optim-mop/benchs/MOP/binh.txt --cy-contract --eps 1 -b largestfirst --nb_ub_sols 10 --w2 0.01
```
